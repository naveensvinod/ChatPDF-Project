# ChatPDF-Project

ChatPDF is an innovative application that enables users to interact with PDF documents through natural language queries. Utilizing the power of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Python, ChatPDF allows users to ask questions about the content of their PDF files and receive precise, contextually accurate answers. This project leverages Google's Gemini API for advanced natural language processing and document retrieval, providing a seamless and intuitive user experience.

# Features

* Natural Language Interaction: Users can ask questions in plain English and receive detailed answers based on the content of their PDF files.
* PDF Document Processing: Efficiently load and parse PDF documents, extracting and structuring text for easy querying.
* Advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Combines document retrieval with generative models to enhance the accuracy and relevance of responses.
* Google Gemini API Integration: Utilizes Google's powerful Gemini API for generating embeddings and conversational responses.
* Streamlit Web Interface: Provides a user-friendly interface for uploading PDF files, asking questions, and viewing responses.
# How It Works

* Load and Parse PDF: The application loads PDF documents and extracts text content, splitting it into manageable chunks for processing.
* Generate Embeddings: Text chunks are converted into embeddings using the Google Gemini API.
* Store and Retrieve: Embeddings are stored in a vector database (e.g., Chroma) and configured for efficient retrieval.
* Query Processing: Users input questions, which are processed to retrieve relevant text chunks from the vector database.
* Answer Generation: Retrieved text chunks are passed to a conversational AI model to generate detailed, contextually relevant answers.
* User Interaction: Users interact with the application through a Streamlit-based web interface, making the entire process intuitive and accessible
